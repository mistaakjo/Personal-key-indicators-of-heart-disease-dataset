## Introduction
Heart disease is the leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, representing 32% of global deaths. With the power of data, we get to investigate and determine what lifestyle habits or conditions that mostly contribute to oneâ€™s likelihood to suffer from heart disease.

## Problem Statement
How can different variables predict whether one has heart disease?

## Libraries used
pandas for dataframes, seaborn, numpy, scipy and matplotlib for plotting graphs, scikit-learn and graphviz for machine learning

## Conclusion
We learnt that for our problem statement, the decision tree model alone is not enough to get a reliable prediction. So we require both linear regression and decision tree to have a model that can predict if someone is more likely to get heart disease. We also have found that although our model is not perfect, we get to know the group of people that are more likely to have or develop heart disease, such as people ages 50 and above. For these groups of people, we can advise them to take healthier life choices to reduce the chances of them getting heart disease, which, to reiterate, is the biggest cause of death currently.
